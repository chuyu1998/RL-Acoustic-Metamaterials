# RL-RL-Acoustic-Metamaterials
This program constructs a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning model that enables the reverse design of acoustic metamaterials with customizable absorption coefficients.To facilitate user operation, we designed a MATLAB-APP program.For more details, please refer to the README file.
